# Jot
Jot is a java application that generates project names similarly to Github's repository suggestions.

If you've ever wnated to regenerate one of these names, this is your program.

# Install
Jot comes as a UI or CLI tool, it's portable so just download the appropriate release.

# Usage
## UI
Press `enter` to genrate names, they will pop up in the output section.

- You can specify the length of descriptors in the top right corner. 
- You can specify the subject of the name in the main input field.

## CLI
To run Jot from the command line use `.\Jot [descriptors] [subject]`

e.g.
`.\Jot 1 Coffee` to generate a project name of 2 words ending in Coffee.

# Roadmap
Soon I will be releasing a seperate launcher for Jot, rather than the current launcher script.
